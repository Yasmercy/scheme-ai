Goals:
- reiterate modularity and cohesion with object libraries
- practice the iterative design process on a larger project

Requirements:
- neural network library with adaptable shape
- selected activation functions, etc.
- hypertuning of learning rate, momentum factor, ...
- supervised learning algorithm with backpropagation

Definitions:
- neuron: a pair of weight and bias numerics that transform an input to an output
- activation-value: the most-recent output of a neuron
- activation-function: the transformation of the dot-product of previous to its activation-value
- momentum: a supervised learning technique to increase the convergence of neural networks
    by remembering the previous shift, and having that influence the speed of the current delta w/b

Array Library:
- constructor (size)
- indexing
- get-size
